        <p>
            <strong>Optional User-Defined Properties:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>pre.cmd.#
                <ul>
                    <li>Optional properties of this type can be added by the user and should be used for <strong>VERY
                            RARE</strong> cases only. You will know when you need to use it when the recipient specifies that you must
                        send FTP commands prior to the transfer. Otherwise, do not use it. You may add these optional properties
                        to send any commands to the FTP server before the file is actually transferred (before the put command).
                        This option is only available for the PutFTP processor, as only FTP has this functionality. This is
                        essentially the same as sending quote commands to an FTP server from the command line.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>NOTE</strong>: While this is the same as sending a quote command, it is very important that
                        you leave off the .
                        (See pre commands above) except that these commands are sent after the file transfer.
                    </li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: true. FlowFile attributes can be used in commands using the expression language</li>
                </ul>
