        <!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
        <h2> Description:</h2>
        <p>
            Runs an operating system command specified by the user and writes the output of that command to a FlowFile. If the command is expected
            to be long-running, the Processor can output the partial data on a specified interval. When this option is used, the output is expected to be in textual
            format, as it typically does not make sense to split binary data on arbitrary time-based intervals.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Properties:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>In the list below, the names of required properties appear
            in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional.
            If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property
            supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply,
            "expression language"), that is also indicated.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Command</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Specifies the command to be executed; if just the name of an executable is provided, it must be in the user's environment PATH.</li>
                    <li>Default value: none</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Command Arguments
                <ul>
                    <li>The arguments to supply to the executable delimited by white space. White space can be escaped by enclosing it in double-quotes.</li>
                    <li>Default value: none</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Working Directory
                <ul>
                    <li>The directory to use as the current working directory when executing the command</li>
                    <li>Default value: none (which means whatever NiFi's root installation directory is)</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Batch Duration
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If the process is expected to be long-running and produce textual output, a batch duration can be specified so 
                        that the output will be captured for this amount of time and a FlowFile will then be sent out with the results
                        and a new FlowFile will be started, rather than waiting for the process to finish before sending out the results.
                        If no value is provided, the process will run to completion and the entire output of the process will be written
                        to a single FlowFile.
                    </li>
                    <li>Default value: none</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Redirect Error Stream
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If true will redirect any error stream output of the process to the output stream.
                        This is particularly helpful for processes which write extensively to the error stream or for troubleshooting.
                    </li>
                    <li>Default value: false</li>
                    <li>Allowed Values: true, false</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
