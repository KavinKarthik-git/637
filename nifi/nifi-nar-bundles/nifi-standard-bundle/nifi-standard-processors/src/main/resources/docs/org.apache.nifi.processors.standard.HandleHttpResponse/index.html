        <!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            This processor responds to an HTTP request that was received by the  
            <a href="../org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.HandleHttpRequest/index.html">HandleHttpRequest</a> Processor.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        	The pairing of this Processor with a <a href="../org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.HandleHttpRequest/index.html">HandleHttpRequest</a> Processor
        	provides the ability to use NiFi to visually construct a web server that can carry out any functionality that is available
        	through the existing Processors. For example, one could construct a Web-based front end to an SFTP Server by constructing a
        	flow such as:
        </p>
        
        <p>
        	<a href="../org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.HandleHttpRequest/index.html">HandleHttpRequest</a> -> 
        	<a href="../org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.PutSFTP/index.html">PutSFTP</a> ->
			<a href="index.html">HandleHttpResponse</a>
        </p>
        
        <p>
        	This Processor must be configured with the same &lt;HTTP Context Map&gt; service as the corresponding HandleHttpRequest Processor.
        	Otherwise, all FlowFiles will be routed to the 'failure' relationship.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        	All FlowFiles must have an attribute named <code>http.context.identifier</code>. The value of this attribute is used to lookup
        	the HTTP Response so that the proper message can be sent back to the requestor. If this attribute is missing, the FlowFile
        	will be routed to 'failure.'
        </p>
        
        
        <p>

        <p>
            In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional. If a property has a default value, it is indicated. If a property supports the use of the NiFi Expression Language (or simply, "expression language"), that is also indicated.

        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTTP Status Code</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The HTTP Status Code to use when responding to the HTTP Request. See Section 10 of RFC 2616 for more information.</li>
                    <li>Default value: no default</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: true</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The HTTP Context Map Controller Service to use for caching the HTTP Request Information</li>
                    <li>Default value: no default</li>
                    <li>Supports expression language: false</li>

            	<ul>
            		<li>
            			A FlowFile will be routed to failure under the following conditions:
            			<ul>
            				<li>The FlowFile does not have an <code>http.context.identifier</code> attribute</li>
            				<li>The <code>http.context.identifier</code> attribute has a value that cannot be found in the HTTP Context Map</li>
            				<li>The HTTP Status Code is not a number</li>
            				<li>There was a communications failure when attempting to write the response to the requestor</li>
            			</ul>
