        <h2>Usage Description</h2>
        <p>
            The pairing of this Processor with a <a href="../org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.HandleHttpResponse/index.html">HandleHttpResponse</a> Processor
            provides the ability to use NiFi to visually construct a web server that can carry out any functionality that is available
            through the existing Processors. For example, one could construct a Web-based front end to an SFTP Server by constructing a
            flow such as:
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="index.html">HandleHttpRequest</a> -> 
            <a href="../org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.PutSFTP/index.html">PutSFTP</a> ->
            <a href="../org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.HandleHttpResponse/index.html">HandleHttpResponse</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            The HandleHttpRequest Processor provides several Properties to configure which methods are supported, the paths that are
            supported, and SSL configuration. The FlowFiles that are generated by this Processor have the following attributes added to
            them, providing powerful routing capabilities and traceability of all data:
