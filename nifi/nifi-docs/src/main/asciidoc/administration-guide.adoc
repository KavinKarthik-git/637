How to install and start NiFi
-----------------------------
NOTE: This section is incomplete.

* Linux
** Decompress and untar into desired installation directory.
** Make any desired edits in files found under <installdir>/conf
** Execute the following commands
*** start: starts NiFi in the background
*** stop: stops NiFi that is running in the background
*** status: provides the current status of NiFi
*** run: runs NiFi in the foreground and waits for a Ctl-C to initiate shutdown of NiFi
*** intall: installs NiFi as a service that can then be controlled via
**** service nifi start
**** service nifi stop
**** service nifi status

Best Practice Configuration
---------------------------
NOTE: Typical Linux defaults are not necessarily well tuned for the needs of an IO intensive application like
NiFi.  For all of these areas your distributions requirements may vary.  Use these sections as advice but
consult your distribution specific documentation for how best to achieve these recommendations.

Maximum File Handles::
NiFi will at any one time potentially have a very large number of file handles open.  Increase the limits by
editing '/etc/security/limits.conf' to add
something like
----
*  hard  nofile  50000
*  soft  nofile  50000
----
Maximum Forked Processes::
NiFi may be configured to generate a significant number of threads.  To increase the allowable number edit '/etc/security/limits.conf'
----
*  hard  nproc  10000
*  soft  nproc  10000
----
And your distribution may require an edit to /etc/security/limits.d/90-nproc.conf by adding
----
*  soft  nproc  10000
----

Increase the number of TCP socket ports available::
This is particularly important if your flow will be setting up and tearing 
down a large number of sockets in small period of time.
----
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range="10000 65000"
----

Set how long sockets stay in a TIMED_WAIT state when closed::
You don't want your sockets to sit and linger too long given that you want to be 
able to quickly setup and teardown new sockets.  It is a good idea to read more about
it but to adjust do something like
----
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.netfilter.ip_conntrack_tcp_timeout_time_wait="1"
----

Tell linux you never want NiFi to swap::
Swapping is fantastic for some applications.  It isn't good for something like
NiFi that always wants to be running.  To tell linux you'd like swapping off you
can edit '/etc/sysctl.conf' to add the following line
----
vm.swappiness = 0
----
For the partions handling the various NiFi repos turn off things like 'atime'.
Doing so can cause a surprising bump in throughput.  Edit the '/etc/fstab' file
and for the partition(s) of interest add the 'noatime' option.

Security Configuration
----------------------
NOTE: This section is incomplete.


Controlling Levels of Access
----------------------------
NOTE: This section is incomplete.

Once NiFi is configured to run securely as discussed in the previous section, it is necessary
to manually designate an ADMIN user in the authorized-users.xml file, which is located in the
root installation's conf directory. After this ADMIN user has been added, s/he may grant access
to other users, systems, and other instances of NiFi, through the User Interface (UI) without having to manually edit the authorized-users.xml
file. If you are the administrator, you would add yourself as the ADMIN user in this file.

Open the authorized-users.xml file in a text editor. You will notice that it includes a template
to guide you, with example entries that are commented out.

It is only necessary to manually add one user, the ADMIN user,
to this file.
So, at a minimum, the following example entry should be included and contain the user Distinguished Name (dn)
in place of "user dn - read only and admin":

----
<users>
    <user dn="[user dn - read only and admin]">
        <role name="ROLE_ADMIN"/>
    </user>
</users>
----

Here is an example entry using the name John Smith:

----
<users>
    <user dn="[cn=John Smith,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com]">
        <role name="ROLE_ADMIN"/>
    </user>
</users>
----

After the authorized-users.xml file has been edited and saved, restart NiFi.
Once the application starts, the ADMIN user is
able to access the UI at the https URL that is configured in the nifi.properties file.

From the UI, click on the Users icon ( image:iconUsers.png["Users", width=32] ) in the
Management Toolbar (upper-right corner of the UI), and the User Management Page opens.

The ADMIN user should be listed. Click on the pencil icon to see this user's role(s). You may edit the
roles by selecting the appropriate checkboxes.

When other users want access to the NiFi UI, they navigate to the configured URL and are
prompted to request access. When someone has requested access, the ADMIN user sees a star
on the Users icon in the Management Toolbar, alerting the ADMIN to the fact that a request is
pending. Upon opening the User Management Page, the pending request is visible, and the ADMIN
can grant access and click on the pencil icon to set the user's roles appropriately.

The ADMIN may also select multiple users and add them to a "Group". Hold down the Shift key and select
multiple users, then click the `Group` button in the upper-right corner of the User Management Page.
Then, provide a name for the group.

The group feature is especially useful when a remote NiFi cluster is connecting to this NiFi using
a Remote Process Group. In that scenario, all the nodes
in the remote cluster can be included in the same group. When the ADMIN wants to grant port access to the remote
cluster, s/he can grant it to the group and avoid having to grant it individually to each node in the cluster.
