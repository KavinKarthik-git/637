## Features

Apache NiFi supports powerful and scalable directed graphs of data routing, transformation, and system mediation logic. Some of the high-level capabilities and objectives of Apache NiFi include:

- Web-based user interface for seamless experience between design, control, feedback, and monitoring of data flows
- Highly configurable along several dimensions of quality of service such as loss tolerant versus guaranteed delivery, low latency versus high throughput, and priority based queuing
- Fine-grained data provenance for all data received, forked, joined, cloned, modified, sent, and ultimately dropped as data reaches its configured end-state
- Component-based extension model along well defined interfaces enabling rapid development and effective testing 

## Getting Started

Execute <nifi install dir>/bin/nifi.sh

## Disclaimer

Apache NiFi is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC.

Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.

While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness
or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be
fully endorsed by the ASF.
