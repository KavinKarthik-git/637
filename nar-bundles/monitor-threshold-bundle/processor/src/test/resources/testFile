This is the test file used in MonitorThreshold  unit tests.
It's content is irrelevant (hence the gibberish below), 
since the primary focus is on its attributes; 
which are setup in the unit tests.
However, its size is relevant, as it affects the unit tests.
The size of this file should be 1,668 bytes.
There is nothing special about the number 1,668.  
It just happened to be the size of the test file that was used for most of the unit tests for the precursor processor,
and it was easier to create a file containing 1,668 bytes than to modify all of the unit tests.
Besides, what difference does it make how big the test file is, as long as it is a known quantity.
