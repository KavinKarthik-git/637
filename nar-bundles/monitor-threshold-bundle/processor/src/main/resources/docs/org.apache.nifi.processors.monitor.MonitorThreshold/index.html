        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This processor examines values found in selected FlowFile attributes and
            maintains counts of the number of times the values have been encountered.  
            The counts are then used to check against user defined thresholds.
            Both the counts and the thresholds can be exposed as FlowFile attributes, for 
            later examination and use by downstream processors.   
        </p>
        <strong>Thresholds for Each Identified Attribute Value</strong>
        <p>One or more FlowFile attributes can be identified for monitoring purposes, using 
            this processorâ€™s advanced user interface (use the Advanced button when configuring the processor).
        </p>  
        <p>In the following example, two FlowFile attributes have been identified: category and priority.  
            In other words, for each FlowFile that is presented to this processor both the category and priority 
            attributes (if they exist) will be examined to see if thresholds have been exceeded.  For each attribute 
            that is identified, different thresholds (and counts) are used for every unique attribute value.  
            Finally, for each attribute value, two types of thresholds are supported; size (bytes) and number of files.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Example Thresholds:</strong></p>

        <br><strong>When Thresholds are Exceeded</strong>
        <p>
            To allow downstream flows (processors) to react, this processor adds two new attributes 
            (<strong>numApplicableThresholds</strong> and <strong>numThresholdsExceeded</strong>) to 
            every FlowFile that passes through the processor, no matter whether a threshold is exceeded.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, if a monitored attribute value is present on a FlowFile, and 
            <strong>'Add Attributes'</strong> is set to 'Only When Threshold Exceeded', 
            this processor will add an additional pair of attributes to each FlowFile that exceeds 
            the threshold; one attribute will contain the threshold and the other attribute will contain the count
            (that exceeded the threshold), e.g., 
        <ul>
            <li>If a byte count threshold is exceeded, both
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>byteCount<i>.attributeName.value</i></strong> and </li> 
                    <li><strong>byteThreshold<i>.attributeName.value</i></strong> </li>
                </ul> 
                attributes will be added to the FlowFile 
            </li>
            <li>If a file count threshold is exceeded, both
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>fileCount<i>.attributeName.value</i></strong> and </li> 
                    <li><strong>fileThreshold<i>.attributeName.value</i></strong> </li>
                </ul> 
                attributes will be added to the FlowFile,
                where <strong><i>attributeName</i></strong> is replaced with the 
                actual attribute name and <strong><i>value</i></strong> is replaced with the actual attribute value. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>For example, assuming the aforementioned thresholds (from the preceding table) are in effect, if
    <ul>
        <li>a FlowFile is encountered with a category value of red,</li> 
        <li>and it is the 11th such file encountered,</li> 
    </ul>
    then the file count threshold (=10) would be exceeded.  
    This would cause the following new attributes to be added to the FlowFile:
    <p>
    <table border="1">
        <tr><th>Attribute Name</th><th>Value</th></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>fileCount.category.red</strong></td><td>11</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>fileThreshold.category.red</strong></td><td>10</td></tr>
    </table>
</p>
</p>
<p>
    Note that when a threshold is exceeded, it is always noted in the 
    log, no matter the value of <strong>'Add Attributes'</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, if a monitored attribute value is present on the FlowFile, and
    <strong>'Add Attributes'</strong> is set to 'Always', <strong>four</strong> additional 
    attributes will be added to FlowFiles, <i>no matter whether a threshold has been exceeded</i>.
    (This can be a convenient mechanism for counting values found in FlowFile attributes.)  
    <br>The four additional attributes are: <strong>fileCount<i>.attributeName.value</i></strong>, 
    a <strong>fileThreshold<i>.attributeName.value</i></strong>, a <strong>byteCount<i>.attributeName.value</i></strong>, 
    and a <strong>byteThreshold<i>.attributeName.value</i></strong> where <strong><i>attributeName</i></strong> is replaced with the 
    actual attribute name and <strong><i>value</i></strong> is replaced with the actual attribute value. 

</p>
<p>
    Note that a FlowFile must have a monitored attribute before corresponding count/threshold attributes will be added.   
    In other words, if a particular FlowFile does not have a monitored attribute, the associated 
    count/threshold attributes will not be added under any circumstances (no matter the value of 'Add Attributes').
</p>

<br><strong>When Multiple Thresholds are Exceeded</strong>
<p>  
    If more than one threshold is exceeded, a pair of attributes are added <i>for each</i> threshold 
    that is exceeded (subject to the values of the 
    <strong>'Add Attributes'</strong> and 
    <strong>'Maximum Attribute Pairs to Add When Multiple Thresholds Exceeded' </strong>properties). 
</p>

<br><strong>Default Thresholds Required</strong>
<p>
    Since the range of possible values (for a particular FlowFile attribute) can be large/unknown
    in advance, it is conceivable that thresholds may not be supplied for all possible values.  
    To account for this possibility, a <strong><i>default threshold must be specified for every attribute that is 
            monitored</i></strong>. Default thresholds are used when a "monitored" attribute has a value for 
    which no thresholds were supplied.
</p>
<p> 
    For example, in the following table, assume that thresholds have been specified for FlowFiles 
    with a category value of red or green, but no thresholds were specified for category values of cyan or magenta.  
    FlowFiles that are encountered with a category value of cyan or magenta will be checked using the default 
    thresholds.

<br><strong>Counting Without Thresholds</strong>
<p>
    When a value (in a monitored attribute) is encountered, but no thresholds have been specified
    for that value, the <strong>'Aggregate Counts When No Threshold Provided'</strong>  determines how counts are maintained.
<ul>
    <li>If false, then :
        <ul>  
            <li>Separate, individual counts are maintained for each non-threshold, value that is encountered.
                As shown in the following table, if a FlowFile has a category value of cyan, its counts would be added to the cyan counts. 
                If a FlowFile has a category value of magenta, its counts would be added to the magenta counts  
                - even though no thresholds were provided for category values cyan or magenta. 
                <table border="1">
                    <tr><th>Attribute Names</th><th>Attribute Values</th><th>Size Threshold (bytes)</th><th><i>byte count</i></th><th>File Threshold</th><th><i>file count</i></th></tr>

                    <tr><td></td><td>yellow</td><td>1000</td><td></td><td>100</td><td></td></tr>
                </table>
                NOTE: Counts (shown in the above table) can <strong>not</strong> be viewed in the Advanced user interface. Only thresholds can be viewed in the Advanced user interface.  
            </li> 
            <li>When a non-threshold value is encountered, it's unique count will be compared with the default threshold.
                So, if a FlowFile has a category value of cyan, the cyan count will be checked against the default thresholds (since no 
                thresholds were provided for a cyan category value).  If a FlowFile has a category value of magenta, magenta  
                counts will be checked against the (same) default thresholds (since no thresholds were provided for a magenta category).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If true (default), then:
        <ul>
            <li>Counts for ALL non-threshold values are aggregated into a single default count.  As shown in the following table, 
                all FlowFiles with a category value of cyan or magenta will have their counts added to a single, default count.</li>

            </table>
            NOTE: Counts (shown in the above table) can <strong>not</strong> be viewed in the Advanced user interface. Only thresholds can be viewed in the Advanced user interface.  
            <li>When a non-threshold value is encountered, the default count (containing counts for both cyan and magenta 
                category values) will be compared to the default threshold.</li>
        </ul>
    </li> 
</ul> 
</p>

<p>NOTE 1: Counts are never maintained for attributes that have not been 
    identified for monitoring, i.e., do not have a default threshold. Once an attribute has
    been identified for monitoring (has a default threshold), counts are always maintained 
    for thresholds that have been specified.  The <strong>'Aggregate Counts When No Threshold Provided'</strong> 
    property only applies in situations where an attribute has been identified for monitoring, and a value is 
    encountered with no threshold.
</p>

<p>
    NOTE 2: If separate counts are maintained for each unique value for each attribute with thresholds
    (<strong>'Aggregate Counts When No Threshold Provided'</strong> is set to <strong>true</strong>), 
    consideration should be given to the choice of attributes to be monitored.  An attribute that is 
    known to have a range of 1 million values, could (ultimately) result in this processor maintaining 
    2 million counts in memory.  
    If the range of values for an attribute are expected to be larger than available memory resources 
    (for maintaining counts), set the <strong>'Aggregate Counts When No Threshold Provided'</strong> property 
    to <strong>false</strong>.  Adopting this approach will require that specific thresholds be provided for any
    attribute values that should be "counted" separately.   
</p>
<p><strong>Separate Instance Equals Separate Counts</strong></p>
<p>
    Each MonitorThreshold instance maintains its own, separate counts.  This is likely the expected 
    behavior when there are multiple MonitorThreshold instances on a flow.  However, this has significant 
    implications when only a single MonitorThreshold instance appears on a flow, but the flow is running 
    on a NiFi <strong><i>cluster</i></strong>.  In this case, each node (in the cluster) will have its 
    own instance of MonitorThreshold, each with its own,independent set of counts (unless MonitorThreshold is running isolated).  
    Assuming an even distribution of FlowFiles across all of the nodes in the
    cluster will result in counts that increase slower, and therefore exceed 
    thresholds later, than might otherwise be expected.  Consequently, thresholds may need to be set lower 
    in clustered environments, in order to achieve desired results.
</p>
<p><strong>Resetting Counts</strong></p>
<p>
    To avoid counts that increase forever (that might eventually force all thresholds to be exceeded), 
    counts are reset on a periodic basis.  Resets can be scheduled for a particular <strong>'Count Reset Time'</strong> 
    every day, or after a specific number of <strong>'Minutes to Wait Before Resetting Counts'</strong> have elapsed. At 
    least one value must be provided.  If <strong>â€œCount Reset Timeâ€�</strong> is not provided, then the minutes to delay 
    are counted from the last reset.  
</p>
<p>
    When counts are reset, the current thresholds, total number of bytes and the number of files seen 
    for each Attribute and Value pair is printed in the logs, and the counts are then reset to zero.
</p>
<p><strong>Changing Thresholds</strong></p>
<p>
    If changes are made to other parameters, such as the size or file thresholds, 
    after the processor has already been running, then the changes will not go into effect until the 
    Minutes to Waitâ€¦ point has been reached. To circumvent this problem, consider temporarily changing the 
    <strong>'Count Reset Time'</strong> (and stop/restart the processor) to force the changes to be implemented sooner; then 
    revert back to the desired <strong>'Count Reset Time'</strong>.
</p>

<p> 
<p><strong>Persisting Counts</strong></p>
<p> 
    To avoid unplanned count resets (due to system restarts, etcâ€¦), counts are persisted to disk on
    a user defined periodic basis according to the <strong>'Frequency to Persist Counts (seconds)'</strong> property.
</p>

                and begin accumulating an aggregate/"default" count for all "non-threshold" values.
                Setting the property back to false, will resume accumulating unique, "non-threshold" counts.
                Since repeatedly changing this property, may give the mistaken appearance that counts are not 
                accurately maintained, it is advised that this property be set to one value and left unchanged
                during a counting "period".  See <strong>Count Reset Time</strong> and 
                <strong>Minutes to Wait Before Resetting Counts </strong> for information on starting a new counting period.

        <li>Default: true</li>
        <li>Supports expression language: false.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Count Reset Time</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The time (24-hour clock, hh:mm:ss format, GMT Timezone) when the byte and file counts 
            will be reset to zero.  All of hours, minutes, and seconds are required, i.e., hh:mm is insufficient.</li>
        <li>Default: none â€“ either <strong>Count Reset Time</strong> or <strong>Minutes to Wait Before Resetting Counts </strong>must be provided.</li>
        <li>Supports expression language: false.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Minutes to Wait Before Resetting Counts</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Minutes to delay count reset, beginning at Count Reset Time, if provided. If Count 
            Reset Time is not provided, then the minutes to delay are counted from the last reset.  
            (Last reset is initially set to the time when the processor is created (added to a flow).)
            <br> NOTE: If changes are made to other 
            parameters, such as the size or file thresholds after the processor has already been running, 
            then the changes will not go into effect until this Minutes to Waitâ€¦ point has been reached. 
            To circumvent this problem, consider temporarily changing the Count Reset Time (and 
            stop/restart the processor) to force the changes to be implemented sooner; then revert back 
            to the desired settings.
        </li>   
        <li>Default: none â€“ either <strong>Count Reset Time</strong> or <strong>Minutes to Wait 
                Before Resetting Counts </strong>must be provided.</li>
        <li>Supports expression language: false.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Add Attributes</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Setting this property to 'Only When Threshold Exceeded' (the default) will cause <strong>two</strong> additional attributes to be added to 
            FlowFiles for every threshold that is exceeded, <i>but only when the threshold is exceeded</i>.  
            <br>For example, if a file count threshold 
            is exceeded, a <strong>fileCount.attributeName.value</strong> and a <strong>fileThreshold.attributeName.value</strong> 
            will be added to the FlowFile.
        <li>Setting this property to 'Always' will cause <strong>four</strong> additional attributes to be added to 
            FlowFiles <i>no matter whether the threshold has been exceeded</i>. 
            <br>The four additional attributes include a <strong>fileCount.attributeName.value</strong>, 
            a <strong>fileThreshold.attributeName.value</strong>, a <strong>byteCount.attributeName.value</strong>, 
            and a <strong>byteThreshold.attributeName.value</strong>.
        <li>Setting this property to 'Never' means do not add additional attributes to FlowFiles.
        <li>Note 1: Attributes are only added if a monitored attribute is present on the FlowFile, no matter 
            the value of this property.
        <li>Note 2: This processor makes a log entry for every threshold 
            that is exceeded, no matter the value of this property.</li>
        <li>Defaults to: 'Only When Threshold Exceeded'.</li>
        <li>Supports expression language: false.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Maximum Attribute Pairs to Add When Multiple Thresholds Exceeded</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Controls/limits the number of FlowFile attributes that are added when 
            multiple thresholds are exceeded.  
            <br>Recall that when a threshold is exceeded,  
            a pair of two attributes are added to the FlowFile, one is the current count and  
            the other is the threshold.  If 100 thresholds are exceeded, then 200 
            attributes will be added to the FlowFile.  Setting this property to zero means add 
            all count/threshold pairs that were exceeded.  Any setting greater than zero indicates  
            how many count/threshold pairs to add when multiple thresholds are exceeded.  
            Only non-negative settings are supported.  The default is 0.  
            <br>NOTE: This property is in effect only when <strong>'Add Attributes'</strong> is 'Only When Threshold Exceeded'. 
            In other words, setting <strong>'Add Attributes'</strong> to 'Always'  or 'Never'
            causes this property to be ignored.
        </li>
        <li>Defaults to: 0</li>
        <li>Supports expression language: false.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>Delimiter to Use for Counts Attributes</li>
    <ul>
    </li><li>The delimiter to use when naming counts that are published as FlowFile 
    attributes, e.g., fileCount.attributeName.value.  
</li><li>Defaults to: â€œ.â€�
</li><li>Supports expression language: false.
</ul>

<li>Attribute to use for Counting Bytes</li>
<ul>
    <li>Setting this property allows a FlowFile attribute to be used for counting bytes, 
        in place of the actual fileSize.  Note that the attribute named by this property must 
        contain only numeric, non-negative integer values for each FlowFile. Non-numeric or 
        negative values that are encountered will be ignored, causing the actual fileSize to 
        be used instead.</li>
    <li>Defaults to: fileSize.</li>
    <li>Supports expression language: false.</li>
</ul>

<li>Frequency to Save Counts (seconds)</li>
<ul>
    <li>How often all of the counts should be written to disk.</li>
    <li>Defaults to: 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>Supports expression language: false.</li>
</ul>

<li>Prefix for Counts Persistence File </li>
<ul>
    <li>The prefix for the file that is persisted to maintain counts across NIFI restarts. 
        The actual name of the state file will be this value plus "-XXXX.state" where XXXX is 
        the processor ID.</li>
    <li>Defaults to: conf/MonitorThreshold</li>
    <li>Supports expression language: false.</li>
</ul>
</ul></p>
<p>
    <strong>Relationships:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>success - all FlowFiles follow this relationship, unless there is a problem with the FlowFile.</li>
    <li>failure - FlowFiles follow this relationship path if there is a problem processing the FlowFile, or if there is a unrecoverable configuration error.</li>
</ul>
